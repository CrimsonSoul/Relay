### Main Process

Entry point: `src/main/index.ts`

Responsibilities:

- Window creation and lifecycle management
- IPC handler registration (delegated to handler modules)
- PocketBase process lifecycle (start, health check, crash recovery)
- External API proxying (weather, geolocation)
- HTTP 401 interception and credential management
- Offline cache reads/writes on behalf of the renderer
- Structured logging with rotation

Key services:

- **PocketBaseProcess** (`pocketbase/PocketBaseProcess.ts`): Spawns and manages the embedded PocketBase binary. Polls `/api/health` until ready. Restarts on crash (up to 3 attempts). Sends SIGTERM on Unix / `taskkill /F` on Windows at shutdown.
- **AppConfig** (`config/AppConfig.ts`): Reads and writes `config.json` (mode, port/serverUrl, secret). Encrypts the secret at rest using Electron `safeStorage` when available.
- **OfflineCache** (`cache/OfflineCache.ts`): Local `better-sqlite3` database storing a snapshot of each PocketBase collection. Used as a fallback data source when PocketBase is unreachable.
- **PendingChanges** (`cache/PendingChanges.ts`): `better-sqlite3` queue of write operations made while offline. Each entry records the collection, action (create/update/delete), payload, and timestamp.
- **SyncManager** (`cache/SyncManager.ts`): Replays the `PendingChanges` queue against PocketBase on reconnect. Detects conflicts by comparing server `updated` timestamps against the client timestamp; logs conflicts to a `conflict_log` collection and applies last-write-wins.
- **CredentialManager** (`credentialManager.ts`): Encrypts/decrypts proxy credentials with Electron `safeStorage`.
- **RateLimiter** (`rateLimiter.ts`): Prevents excessive API calls.
- **Logger** (`logger.ts`): Structured logging with file rotation, error categorization, sensitive data sanitization.

### Preload

Entry point: `src/preload/index.ts`

Exposes a typed `window.api` object via `contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld`. Every method maps to an `ipcRenderer.invoke` or `ipcRenderer.on` call. The renderer never imports Electron or Node.js modules directly.

The full API surface is defined by the `BridgeAPI` type in `src/shared/ipc.ts`. The bridge is intentionally narrow: it covers window management, weather/location APIs, auth, clipboard, setup, cache/sync, logging, and PocketBase bootstrap. All data CRUD (contacts, servers, on-call, etc.) bypasses IPC entirely — the renderer calls the PocketBase REST API directly via the `pocketbase` SDK.

### Renderer

Entry point: `src/renderer/src/App.tsx`

React application with sidebar navigation and 7 tabs. Uses the "mount once, keep alive" pattern — once a tab is visited, it stays in the DOM (hidden via CSS) to preserve state and scroll position. Only the Compose tab loads eagerly; others use `React.lazy`.

State is managed through custom hooks (one per feature domain) that call the PocketBase SDK directly for data operations, and `window.api` methods for system-level operations. Context providers handle cross-cutting concerns (location, notes, connection state).

The renderer's PocketBase client is initialized in `src/renderer/src/services/pocketbase.ts`. This module exports `initPocketBase`, `authenticate`, `getPb`, and connection-state helpers (`onConnectionStateChange`, `isOnline`, `startHealthCheck`). Services under `src/renderer/src/services/` (e.g. `contactService.ts`, `serverService.ts`, `oncallService.ts`) build on `getPb()` to call collection endpoints directly.

### Shared

Location: `src/shared/`

Contains TypeScript types, IPC channel definitions, Zod validation schemas, and phone number utilities. Imported by main, preload, and renderer.

## Data Handling

### Storage Format

All application data is stored in PocketBase's embedded SQLite database. The following collections are defined:

| Collection        | Contents                                              |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `contacts`        | Contact records (name, email, phone, title)           |
| `servers`         | Server records (name, business area, owner, OS, etc.) |
| `bridge_groups`   | Bridge group presets (name, contact emails)           |
| `on_call`         | On-call records (team, role, name, contact)           |
| `on_call_layout`  | Drag-and-drop grid layout for the on-call board       |
| `bridge_history`  | Bridge composition log (groups, contacts, timestamp)  |
| `alert_history`   | Alert composition log                                 |
| `notes`           | Contact and server notes with tags                    |
| `saved_locations` | Weather saved locations                               |

Schema migrations live in `src/main/pocketbase/migrations/` and are applied automatically on startup via the `--migrationsDir` flag.

### Database Access Pattern

The renderer talks to PocketBase directly over HTTP (localhost). There is no IPC proxy for collection reads or writes — the `pocketbase` SDK in the renderer process issues REST calls to `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`. PocketBase provides ACID transactions and enforces record-level access rules.

The main process holds a separate `PocketBase` client instance used only by `SyncManager` for replaying the offline queue.

### Offline Fallback

When PocketBase is unreachable the renderer falls back to data cached in `OfflineCache`. Writes made offline are recorded in `PendingChanges`. On reconnect the renderer calls `window.api.syncPending()`, which triggers `SyncManager.syncAll()` in the main process to flush the queue.

### Realtime Subscriptions

The renderer uses the PocketBase SDK's realtime subscription API (`pb.collection(...).subscribe(...)`) to receive push updates from the server. This replaces the chokidar file-watcher used in the previous architecture.

### Crash Safety

The PocketBase binary uses SQLite WAL mode. If the process is terminated unexpectedly, SQLite's WAL recovery ensures data integrity on the next startup. `PocketBaseProcess.killSync()` is called during Electron's `before-quit` event to release the WAL lock cleanly before exit.

## IPC Contracts

### Channel Naming

Channels follow the `domain:action` convention and are defined as string constants in `IPC_CHANNELS` (`src/shared/ipc.ts`).

### Current IPC Surface

Data CRUD for all collections is handled directly by the renderer via the PocketBase REST API — it does **not** go through IPC. IPC is used only for:

```
window:minimize, window:maximize, window:close, window:isMaximized,
window:maximizeChange, window:openAux
fs:openPath, shell:openExternal
auth:requested, auth:submit, auth:cancel, auth:useCached
weather:get, weather:search, weather:alerts
location:ip
cloudstatus:get
radar:data, config:registerRadarUrl
clipboard:write, clipboard:writeImage
alert:saveImage, alert:saveCompanyLogo, alert:getCompanyLogo, alert:removeCompanyLogo
drag:started, drag:stopped
oncall:alertDismissed
setup:getConfig, setup:saveConfig, setup:isConfigured
cache:read, cache:write, cache:snapshot
sync:pending
pb:getUrl, pb:getSecret, pb:start
logger:toMain, metrics:logBridge
```

### Validation

Every handler validates its input with Zod schemas before processing. The `validateIpcDataSafe` function from `src/shared/ipcValidation.ts` parses input and logs validation failures. Invalid input returns `{ success: false, error: 'Invalid input' }` without throwing.

### Return Types

Mutation handlers return `IpcResult<T>`:

```typescript
type IpcResult<T = void> = {
  success: boolean;
  data?: T;
  error?: string;
  rateLimited?: boolean;
};
```

Query handlers return the data directly (arrays, objects, or null).

## Tab Behaviors

### Compose (AssemblerTab)

Build communication bridges from contacts and groups. The sidebar lists available groups with checkboxes. Selected contacts appear in a virtualized composition list. "Draft Bridge" copies the assembled contact list to the clipboard and logs the bridge to history.

Sub-components: `AssemblerSidebar`, `CompositionList`, `VirtualRow`, `SaveGroupModal`, `BridgeHistoryModal`, `BridgeReminderModal`, `SidebarToggleHandle`

Bridge history auto-saves silently (no prompt). History entries record the groups used, all contact emails, and a timestamp. History entries older than 30 days are pruned automatically; max 500 entries.

### On-Call Board (PersonnelTab)

Drag-and-drop grid of on-call teams. Each team card shows role assignments. Teams can be created, renamed, deleted, and reordered. Supports popout to a separate window via `openAuxWindow`. Cross-window drag state is synchronized via IPC (`drag:started`, `drag:stopped`).

Smart reminders appear on Monday/Wednesday/Friday prompting schedule updates. Auto-refresh updates data even when the app is left running.

### People (DirectoryTab)

Searchable, virtualized contact directory. Supports add/edit/delete contacts, group filtering, context menus (right-click or Shift+F10), and keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Enter to select). Contacts can be pushed directly into the Compose tab.

### Servers (ServersTab)

Virtualized server list with search, context menus, and notes. Displays business area, owner, contact, and OS for each server.

### Weather (WeatherTab)

Dashboard showing current conditions, hourly forecast, daily forecast, and severe weather alerts. Locations can be auto-detected via IP, searched by name, or saved. Multiple saved locations supported with a default setting.

### Radar (RadarTab)

Embedded weather radar via webview. The webview source is locked to an HTTPS allowlist. Webview creation is validated by the `will-attach-webview` handler in the main process.

### AI Chat (AIChatTab)

Sandboxed access to Gemini and ChatGPT via webview. Session data is automatically cleared when leaving the tab. Webviews run in strict isolation with no access to app data or the main process.

## Security

### Context Isolation

All renderer windows run with `contextIsolation: true` and `sandbox: true`. The renderer has no access to Node.js globals, `require`, or Electron modules. All communication goes through the typed `window.api` bridge.

### Content Security Policy

Strict CSP headers are set on all windows in `src/main/index.ts`. Script sources are limited to `self`. External connections are allowlisted by domain.

### Webview Security

Webview creation is intercepted by `will-attach-webview` in the main process. Only URLs matching the HTTPS allowlist are permitted. Navigation events and `window.open()` are blocked.

### Credential Management

Sensitive credentials (proxy auth, cached passwords, PocketBase secret) are encrypted using Electron's `safeStorage` API in the main process. The renderer never handles raw credentials — it submits them via IPC with a one-time nonce, and the main process encrypts and stores them.

The PocketBase secret stored in `config.json` is encrypted at rest via `AppConfig.save()` when `safeStorage.isEncryptionAvailable()` returns true; a plaintext fallback is used only in headless/CI environments.

### Path Validation

All file paths are validated against directory traversal attacks by `src/main/pathValidation.ts` before any file operation.

### Log Sanitization

The logger automatically strips sensitive fields (passwords, tokens, authorization headers) from log output before writing to disk.

## Logging

Structured logging with automatic rotation. See [LOGGING.md](LOGGING.md) for the full guide.

Main process: `src/main/logger.ts` — writes to `relay.log` and `errors.log`
Renderer: `src/renderer/src/utils/logger.ts` — forwards to main via IPC

Log files are stored in platform-specific app data directories:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Relay/logs/`
- Windows: `%AppData%\Relay\logs\`
- Linux: `~/.config/Relay/logs/`

Rotation at 10MB, 5 backups retained.

## Build Targets

| Platform | Target   | Architecture | Artifact           |
| -------- | -------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| macOS    | DMG      | arm64 + x64  | `Relay-{arch}.dmg` |
| Windows  | Portable | x64          | `Relay.exe`        |

Build output goes to `release/`. Configuration in `electron-builder.yml`.

ASAR packaging enabled. Test files, config files, docs, and source maps are excluded from the build.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Vitest)

Two separate configs for different environments:

- `vitest.config.ts` — Node environment for main process and shared code
- `vitest.renderer.config.ts` — jsdom environment for renderer code

Coverage thresholds are enforced in both configs. Tests are co-located with source code (either `*.test.ts` next to the file or in `__tests__/` directories).

### E2E Tests (Playwright)

Located in `tests/e2e/`. Run against the packaged Electron application. Configuration in `playwright.electron.config.ts`.

### Quality Gates

All must pass before merge:

- `npm run typecheck` — 0 TypeScript errors
- `npm run lint` — 0 ESLint errors/warnings (includes jsx-a11y)
- `npm test` — all unit + renderer tests pass
- Coverage thresholds met
- Pre-commit hooks pass (eslint --fix + prettier --write via husky)
