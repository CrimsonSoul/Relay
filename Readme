This repository is initialized with Vite + React + TypeScript and Electron using `electron-vite`.

## Getting started
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Run the app in development with `npm run dev`.
3. Create production builds with `npm run build` or preview with `npm run preview`.

## Structure
- `src/main`: Electron main process (window creation, IPC, chokidar wiring).
- `src/preload`: Context bridge exposing typed IPC helpers to the renderer.
- `src/renderer`: React renderer powered by Vite with stub tabs (Assembler, Directory, Radar).
- `src/shared`: Shared IPC contracts used across processes.

The renderer includes placeholder UI for the three primary tabs and messaging about the IPC bridge to guide further implementation.
# NOC Workshop

NOC Workshop is a desktop application that pairs a Vite-powered UI with an Electron shell to help operators monitor and act on streaming tabular data with high precision.

## Project goals
- Deliver a responsive, reliable desktop experience that feels like precision instrumentation.
- Keep the UI focused on clarity: highlight anomalies, limit distractions, and keep essential actions one click away.
- Provide predictable data handling: every ingest is traceable, validated, and surfaced through a transparent pipeline.
- Encourage extendability by documenting IPC boundaries and testing strategy.

## Styling philosophy: Analog Precision
- Visual language is inspired by physical control panels: crisp typography, restrained color palettes, and meaningful affordances.
- Controls favor tactile cues (outlined buttons, toggles, dials) over heavy gradients or drop shadows.
- Layouts prioritize hierarchy and legibility for fast scanning; animation is minimal and purposeful.

## Getting started (Electron + Vite)
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
2. Start the development shell: `npm run dev` (launches Vite with Electron).
3. Build a distributable: `npm run build` (bundles Vite assets and packages Electron).

See [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for environment details, IPC contracts, data processing, and testing notes.

## Architecture highlights
- A file watcher ingests CSV/TSV sources, validates row-level schemas, and streams parsed events to the renderer.
- IPC keeps renderer and main process isolated: only vetted commands and payloads cross the boundary.
- Tabbed workflows map to operator roles (Monitor, Review, Actions) with guarded navigation when data changes.
- Authentication requests are intercepted in the main process to enforce consistent tokens before HTTP calls leave the app.

## Testing strategy
- Unit-test parsing, IPC handlers, and UI state reducers.
- Integration-test end-to-end flows with Electron + Vite builds to catch packaging regressions.
- Prefer deterministic fixtures for streaming data; cover both happy-path and malformed inputs.
- End-to-end UI smoke tests use Playwright. Install the test runner and browser binaries with `npm install` followed by `npx playwright install chromium`, then run `npm test` to start a preview server, exercise the renderer shell, and capture baseline screenshots for review.

For deeper implementation guidance, review `docs/architecture.md`.
