Operators Atelier
=================

This repository is initialized with Vite + React + TypeScript and Electron using `electron-vite`.

## Getting started
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Run the app in development with `npm run dev`.
3. Create production builds with `npm run build` or preview with `npm run preview`.

## Structure
- `src/main`: Electron main process (window creation, IPC, chokidar wiring).
- `src/preload`: Context bridge exposing typed IPC helpers to the renderer.
- `src/renderer`: React renderer powered by Vite with stub tabs (Assembler, Directory, Radar).
- `src/shared`: Shared IPC contracts used across processes.

The renderer includes placeholder UI for the three primary tabs and messaging about the IPC bridge to guide further implementation.
